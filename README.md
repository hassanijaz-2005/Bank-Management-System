Bank Account Management System (C++)

This is a console-based **Bank Account Management System** developed using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It simulates the core functions of a banking system, such as creating accounts, making secure deposits and withdrawals, and tracking the total balance held across all accounts.

Features
- Create new bank accounts with account number, name, deposit, and 4-digit PIN
- View account details
- Secure deposit and withdrawal operations (PIN verification required)
- Track total bank balance (globally updated)
- Dynamic storage using a singly linked list

Concepts Covered
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Encapsulation)
- Pointers and dynamic memory allocation
- Linked list data structure
- Menu-driven program flow
- Basic user input validation and security

 Menu Options
1. Create New Account  
2. Search for an Account  
3. Deposit Money  
4. Withdraw Money  
5. Exit  

Each transaction checks for the correct 4-digit PIN before proceeding, ensuring only authorized access. Upon exiting, all dynamically created account nodes are deallocated to prevent memory leaks.

Technologies Used
- C++ (OOP, Pointers)
- Standard Input/Output

 Ideal For
This project is great for:
- Students practicing OOP in C++
- Beginners learning dynamic memory and linked lists
- Demonstrating simple real-world applications of programming concepts
This is a basic educational project and does not cover advanced banking features like interest, account deletion, or data persistence (e.g., file handling).
 Feel free to fork this repo, try it out, and modify it to add more features!
